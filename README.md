## Values, Rules, and Constraints

On 3/12/2021, Cem Eskinazi and I met up to talk about a web project to compliment and accompany his forthcoming typeface, "Ray" (name to change). I'd spent the previous month or so messing around with an [interactive fluid simulator](https://github.com/nicschumann/fairly-fast-fluids) based on the energy and disposition of the typeface design â€“ But we'd both independently arrived at a the conclusion that we wanted something more narrative, more engaging, and more game-y.

We made a list of constraints that we hope the project will satisfy. I'm reproducing that list here, because it's our jumping off point.

- Works on Desktop and Mobile equally well
- Centers **one** interaction; simple
- Done in two weeks
- Short iteration and prototyping times
- "Ray" is the source material
- Type is the protagonist
- It's an infinite game (in the sense of [Carse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games))

"Ray" is a typeface with a psychedelic energy; the process of designing "Ray" was a visual and perceptual trip. We want to make an experience with takes the player on this perceptual trip using the motif of growing a garden of mushrooms, tending to the garden, harvesting spores, and progressively engaging with the increasingly hallucinatory aspects of "Ray". This gradual unwinding of the typeface's designspace as you play is the trip, which reflects our own trip in designing the typeface, and designing this experience. Through a combination of storytelling, a feedback loop of choices and an unfolding experienceof the type design, we hope to take the player on a trip that connects them with the sensibilities at the core of "Ray".

## Trip Levels

One layer of progression is the parts of the designspace and the character set that the player can see. Different glyphs have different degrees of psychedelia, and different styles of the typeface have different levels of psychedelia associated with them.

| Level 0 | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 |
| - | - | - |  - | - |
| Georgia | Ray Regular| Ray Bold *or* Ray Light | Ray Black *or* Ray ExtraLight | Ray Ultra |

Different paths through this progress happen, depending on what you choose to do.
