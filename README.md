## Values, Rules, and Constraints

On 3/12/2021, Cem Eskinazi and I met up to talk about a web project to compliment and accompany his forthcoming typeface, "Ray" (name to change). I'd spent the previous month or so messing around with an [interactive fluid simulator](https://github.com/nicschumann/fairly-fast-fluids) based on the energy and disposition of the typeface design â€“ But we'd both independently arrived at a the conclusion that we wanted something more narrative, more engaging, and more game-y.

We made a list of constraints that we hope the project will satisfy. I'm reproducing that list here, because it's our jumping off point.

- Works on Desktop and Mobile equally well
- Centers **one** interaction; simple
- Done in two weeks
- Short iteration and prototyping times
- "Ray" is the source material
- Type is the protagonist
- It's an infinite game (in the sense of [Carse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games))

"Ray" is a typeface with a psychedelic energy; the process of designing "Ray" was a visual and perceptual trip. We want to make an experience with takes the player on this perceptual trip using the motif of growing a garden of mushrooms, tending to the garden, harvesting spores, and progressively engaging with the increasingly hallucinatory aspects of "Ray". This gradual unwinding of the typeface's designspace as you play is the trip, which reflects our own trip in designing the typeface, and designing this experience. Through a combination of storytelling, a feedback loop of choices and an unfolding experienceof the type design, we hope to take the player on a trip that connects them with the sensibilities at the core of "Ray".

## Trip Levels

One layer of progression is the parts of the designspace and the character set that the player can see. Different glyphs have different degrees of psychedelia, and different styles of the typeface have different levels of psychedelia associated with them.

| Level 0 | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 |
| - | - | - |  - | - |
| Georgia | Ray Regular| Ray Bold *or* Ray Light | Ray Black *or* Ray ExtraLight | Ray Ultra |

Different paths through this progress happen, depending on what you choose to do.


## Play

The "purpose" of the game is to collect as much of "Ray" (if you think of collecting "Ray" as collecting glyphs across weights) as you can over the course of play.

There are three fields of play in the game. One is the `garden`: an 8x8 grid. Another is the `field guide`, a list of all the plants the player has encountered, as well as a collection of what the player currently has in their current collection. The number of "slots" in the field guide is a parameter to the game. The third and final is the `log book`. The story of the garden unfolds in the logbook, where the main characters record their thoughts and experiences as you progress through the game.

The game consists of an infinite sequence of turns. During each turn, you transition through the following states:

**Player.** You start your turn with a certain number of clicks to spend (this is a parameter for the game. For this explanation, let's say it's 3 clicks). You can click on squares in the grid. What happens depends on what you click on. There are a few different types of squares in the grid:

- `Mushrooms`
  - If you click on a garden square containing a mushroom, you harvest it, and it's removed from the garden and added to your field guide's inventory.
  - If you click an inventory square containing a mushroom, you eat the mushroom. This changes your perception of the world, which changes the way you see the mushrooms, flowers, and weeds in the garden. (basically, this is leveling up. This can also convert certain weeds into flowers, and flowers into weeds).
  - If you wait and keep the mushroom in your inventory, after a certain number of turns it will rot and turn into `spores`.

- `Flowers`
  - If you click a garden square containing a flower, the flower is added to your inventory and removed from the garden grid. The flower is also then added to your flower vase, where it remains for some turns (depending on the flower, as long as you keep the flower in your inventory). The number of flowers in your vase increases the number of clicks you can spend per turn (again, based on the number of turns).
  - If you click on an inventiry square containing a flower, you harvest seeds from it. It's removed from your inventory, and replaced by `seeds`. Planting seeds increases the (high) likelyhood that flowers of the same sort will grow there).
  - If you wait and keep the flower in your inventiry, after a certain number of turns it will wilt and be removed from your inventory.


- `Weeds`
  - If you click a garden square containing a weed, you'll pick the weed, and add it to your inventory, and remove it from the grid.
  - If you click an inventory square containing a weed, then you turn the weed into `compost` immediately
  - If you wait and keep the weeds in your inventory, it will eventually decay into `compost`.


- `Spores`
  - Spores show up in your inventory if you let a mushroom rot instead of eating it. You can then plant the spores, and increase the likelihood of mushrooms growing in the garden square you click on by a little.
  - If wait and don't use the spores, they will decay and be removed from your inventory.


- `Seeds`
  - Seeds show up in your inventory if you harvest them from a flower. You can plant these seeds, and increase the likelihood that flowers will grow in that square by a lot!
  - Seeds never leave your inventory unless you plant them.


- `Compost`
  - Compost shows up in your inventory if you click on a weed, or if you wait for a while with the weed in your inventory. If you scatter compost over a garden square, then you increase all the likelihoods of things growing in proportion to their current likelihood.
  - If you wait and don't use the compost, it increases its potency.

#### Environment

After you've spent all your clicks, it's the environment's turn to act. The environment's actions happen in two phases: first, the transition probabilities are updated based on the current state of the garden grid. Then, your inventory state is updated.

Each square in the garden can be in one of four states.

- `Empty`. If the square is empty, then it either becomes a flower, a mushroom, a weed, or nothing happens, depending on a discrete probability distribution assigned to that square.

- `Flower`. If the square is a flower, then in its next state, it either becomes a bigger flower, or it doesn't grow.

- `Mushroom`. If the square is a mushroom, then in its next state, it either becomes a bigger mushroom, or decays.

- `Weed`. If a square is a weed, then it grows with probability 1. In addition, it increases the likelyhood of weeds in adjacent empty cells, decreases the likelyhood of growth in neighboring cells for both mushrooms and flowers.

Your inventory state is pretty simple. Each item has a lifespan (with the exception of seeds, and compost), and the lifespan is decremented. If a lifespan hits zero, the item is removed from your inventory.

#### Narrative

Narrative elements are revealed as you reach different states of the garden and inventory. Whenever a state is changed, the narrative flow is checked and new entries are added as relevant. One entry per click.


#### Endgame

You "win" when the garden is full of flowers. However, you can keep playing indefinitely, because flowers you can pick flowers and keep playing as you choose. However, if you don't interact and the garden is full of flowers, it will grow indefinitely. Keep your browser open!

You lose if the garden is full of weeds, because then there's no way to grow mushrooms or flowers. Of course, you could try and get lucky, by picking weeds and hoping a flower grows, but that's ... pretty hard.
